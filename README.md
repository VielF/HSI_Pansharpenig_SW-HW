[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Overview
This repository presents the code of a hardware accelerator designed to execute a pansharpening algorithm. This algorithm combines hyperspectral and panchromatic images to create an HSI with a higher spatial resolution. The hardware accelerator is both energy-efficient and suitable for onboard processing in small spacecraft, such as satellites.
